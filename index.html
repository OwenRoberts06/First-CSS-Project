      <h3>Guitar/Music</h3>
      <p>
        One of my main hobby's is guitar, I've been playing guitar for eight</br>
        years now. For most of those years I was playing classical guitar though</br>
        I made the switch to electric guitar about 1<sup>1/2</sup> years. I enjoy playing metal</br>
          music and also like to listen to music all the time. I mainly listen to</br>
         metal and enjoy Slipknot and Avenged sevenfold the most out of the bands I like.
